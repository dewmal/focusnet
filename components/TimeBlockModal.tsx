I notice this is a React Native component that implements a time block modal with enhanced time picker functionality. The new version adds several improvements including:

1. Enhanced time picker UI with quick select options and custom time selection
2. More intuitive hour/minute/period selectors with up/down controls
3. Additional imports (ChevronDown, ChevronUp)
4. New state variables for time picker (selectedHour, selectedMinute, selectedPeriod)
5. New styles for the enhanced time picker interface
6. Additional helper functions for time handling
7. Improved validation and error handling

I'll generate the complete updated file with all changes merged and preserved. The output will be the raw file content only, maintaining exact formatting and including all new functionality while preserving existing features.
